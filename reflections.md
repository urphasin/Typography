At this point I started thinking about the project


## Session 2 (Feb 1st 2026)
I am reading the project and starting to reflect about fonts. I complete the discussion at 4:30PM. The discussion was very inspirational. I watched FreeCodeCamp video on Typography. The video was 2 hours long. 


# Reflections
1. What I did: What did you create and how long did it take?
    * #### I made a typography specimen
2. What worked well: Which design decision are you most proud of?

3. What was tricky: What was hardest about making design choices?

4. Key insight: What did you learn about typography, color, or spacing that surprised you?
    * #### Typography is actually pleasant to think about.
5. Next steps: What will you work on improving in the next lab? (1 paragraph)
